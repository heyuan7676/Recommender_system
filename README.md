The problem is to predict a userâ€™s rating for a movie based on the ratings the user previously gives to other movies, as well as ratings provided by other users. This is essentially a matrix completion problem.
<br>
The data is a matrix of users by movies, with each entry being a rating score from 1 to 5. The characteristic of the data is that since not every user rates every movie, actually most users would usually rate a small number of movies, which makes the matrix very sparse.

We compared three method: 
> Matrix factorization. The objective function is the num of squared residuals in the scope of available data, and l2 penalty on the two decomposed matrices. 
> Robust PCA ( to deal with outliers and errors). With prior information we know that the true matrix should have a low rank, the augmented Lagrangian function was created. 
> Low rank matrix completion. The matrix is optimized to have small nuclear norm and constrained to have the same values as the observed matrix in scope of available data.

We compared the performance using manually masked data from MovieLens, and RMSE was used to evaluate the performance. Matrix factorization performs the best.

We also did clustering in the high-dimensional space using spectral clustering and locally linear manifold clustering, and found meaningful clusters of movies.
